# Prusa XL Printable Parts

This repository exists because Prusa does not (yet) publish change logs or a revision history for the printable parts for the Prusa XL printer. This repo aims to keep a history of the parts published at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/449554-xl-printable-parts). Noticing that new parts have been published and adding a commit is currently a manual process. The history starts with the publication from 2023-11-24, and there may be gaps going forwards if changes are not noticed.

The filename of the PDF from the downloaded zip has a changing GUID-like suffix which is removed from the committed file.

The zip, as with the model on Printables, sometimes has more than one file with the same name in the same folder (eg, `Nextruder Single Tool/extruder-front-case.stl`). I allow the unzip process to automatically rename duplicate files when unzipping.

# Contributing

If you notice that the parts on Printables have been updated (check the "updated" date on the Printables model page), please download all the files as a zip using the `ALL MODEL FILES` button on the files tab, then create a new GitHub issue here and attach the zip. The issue should be titled "Update from 2024-01-15" (but with the correct date in YYYY-MM-DD format). If the issue already exists, feel free to add a comment with your download of the zip. If I don't manage to download the zip myself before a new update happens, I will make some effort to verify that the contributed zip is real and valid. I'll make clear in any commit if the source was not validated.
